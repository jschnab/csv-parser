# CSV parser

This work is in progress and has to be treated as a programming exercise.

This program written in C reads a CSV file line by line and prints the median
of each line on the console.

The end goal is to replicate the functionality of
[pyms](https://github.com/jschnab/pyms-plot). The first step is to calculate
the median of values grouped according to two indices, then to plot these
values as as scatter plot.
